## Recommended local disk sizes for your gateway<a name="disk-sizes-fsx"></a>

The following table recommends sizes for local disk storage for your deployed gateway\. 


| Gateway Type | Cache \(Minimum\) | Cache \(Maximum\) | Other Required Local Disks | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- | 
| FSx File Gateway | 150 GiB | 64 TiB | â€” | 

**Note**  
You can configure one or more local drives for your cache up to the maximum capacity\.  
When adding cache to an existing gateway, it's important to create new disks in your host \(hypervisor or Amazon EC2 instance\)\. Don't change the size of existing disks if the disks have been previously allocated as a cache\.
