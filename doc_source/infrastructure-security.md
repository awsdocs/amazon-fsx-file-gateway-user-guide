# Infrastructure security in AWS Storage Gateway<a name="infrastructure-security"></a>

As a managed service, AWS Storage Gateway is protected by the AWS global network security procedures that are described in [Security Pillar \- AWS Well\-Architected Framework](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/welcome.html)\.

You use AWS published API calls to access Storage Gateway through the network\. Clients must support Transport Layer Security \(TLS\) 1\.0 or later\. We recommend TLS 1\.2 or later\. Clients must also support cipher suites with perfect forward secrecy \(PFS\) such as Ephemeral Diffie\-Hellman \(DHE\) or Elliptic Curve Ephemeral Diffie\-Hellman \(ECDHE\)\. Most modern systems such as Java 7 and later support these modes\.

Additionally, requests must be signed by using an access key ID and a secret access key that is associated with an IAM principal\. Or you can use the [AWS Security Token Service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html) \(AWS STS\) to generate temporary security credentials to sign requests\.

**Note**  
You should treat the AWS Storage Gateway appliance as a managed embedded device, and should not attempt to access or modify its installation in any way\. Attempting to install scanning software or update any software packages using methods other than the normal gateway update mechanism, may cause the gateway to malfunction and could impact our ability to support or fix the gateway\.  
AWS reviews, analyzes, and remediates CVEs on a regular basis, which we incorporate into the AWS Storage Gateway in our normal software release cycle\. These updates are typically released twice per year and are applied as part of the normal gateway update process during scheduled maintenance windows\.
