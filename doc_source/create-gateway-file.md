**Note**  
If you require FIPS 140\-2 validated cryptographic modules when accessing AWS through a command line interface or an API, use a FIPS\-compliant endpoint\. For more information, see [Federal Information Processing Standard \(FIPS\) 140\-2](http://aws.amazon.com/compliance/fips/)\.  
The FIPS service endpoint is available only in some AWS Regions\. For more information, see [AWS Storage Gateway endpoints and quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/sg.html) in the *AWS General Reference*\.
   + **VPC hosted** – Your gateway communicates with AWS through a private connection with your virtual private cloud \(VPC\), allowing you to control your network settings\. If you select this option, you must specify an existing VPC endpoint by choosing its VPC endpoint ID from the dropdown list\. You can also provide its VPC endpoint Domain Name System \(DNS\) name or IP address\.

1. In the **Gateway connection options** section, for **Connection options**, choose how to identify your gateway to AWS\. You can choose from the following options:
   + **IP address** – Provide the IP address of your gateway in the corresponding field\. This IP address must be public or accessible from within your current network, and you must be able to connect to it from your web browser\.

     You can obtain the gateway IP address by logging into the gateway's local console from your hypervisor client, or by copying it from your Amazon EC2 instance details page\.
   + **Activation key** – Provide the activation key for your gateway in the corresponding field\. You can generate an activation key using the gateway's local console\. If your gateway's IP address is unavailable, choose this option\.

1. Now that you have chosen how you want your gateway to connect to AWS, you must activate the gateway\. Choose **Next** to proceed\.

## Review settings and activate your Amazon FSx File Gateway<a name="review-and-activate-fsx-file"></a>
