# AWS Security Best Practices<a name="security-best-practice"></a>

AWS provides a number of security features to consider as you develop and implement your own security policies\. These best practices are general guidelines and donâ€™t represent a complete security solution\. Because these practices might not be appropriate or sufficient for your environment, treat them as helpful considerations rather than prescriptions\. For more information, see [AWS Security Best Practices](https://d1.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/Security/AWS_Security_Best_Practices.pdf)\.
