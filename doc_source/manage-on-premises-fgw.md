## Logging in to the file gateway local console<a name="LocalConsole-login-fgw"></a>

When the VM is ready for you to log in, the login screen is displayed\. If this is your first time logging in to the local console, you use the default user name and password to log in\. These default login credentials give you access to menus where you can configure gateway network settings and change the password from the local console\. Storage Gateway enables you to set your own password from the Storage Gateway console instead of changing the password from the local console\. You don't need to know the default password to set a new password\. For more information, see [Logging in to the file gateway local console](#LocalConsole-login-fgw)\.

**To log in to the gateway's local console**
+ If this is your first time logging in to the local console, log in to the VM with the default credentials\. The default user name is `admin` and the password is `password`\. Otherwise, use your credentials to log in\.
**Note**  
We recommend changing the default password\. You do this by running the `passwd` command from the local console menu \(item 6 on the main menu\)\. For information about how to run the command, see [Running storage gateway commands on the local console](#MaintenanceGatewayConsole-fgw)\. You can also set the password from the Storage Gateway console\. For more information, see [Logging in to the file gateway local console](#LocalConsole-login-fgw)\.

### Setting the local console password from the Storage Gateway console<a name="set-password-fgw"></a>

When you log in to the local console for the first time, you log in to the VM with the default credentials\. For all types of gateways, you use default credentials\. The user name is `admin` and the password is `password`\.

We recommend that you always set a new password immediately after you create your new gateway\. You can set this password from the Storage Gateway console rather than the local console if you want\. You don't need to know the default password to set a new password\.

**To set the local console password on the Storage Gateway console**

1. Open the Storage Gateway console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/storagegateway/home](https://console.aws.amazon.com/storagegateway/)\.

1. On the navigation pane, choose **Gateways**, and then choose the gateway for which you want to set a new password\.

1. For **Actions**, choose **Set Local Console Password**\.

1. In the **Set Local Console Password** dialog box, enter a new password, confirm the password, and then choose **Save**\. 

   Your new password replaces the default password\. Storage Gateway doesn't save the password but rather safely transmits it to the VM\.
**Note**  
The password can consist of any character on the keyboard and can be 1â€“512 characters long\.

## Configuring an HTTP proxy<a name="MaintenanceRoutingProxy-fgw"></a>

 File gateways support configuration of an HTTP proxy\. 

**Note**  
The only proxy configuration that file gateways support is HTTP\.

If your gateway must use a proxy server to communicate to the internet, then you need to configure the HTTP proxy settings for your gateway\. You do this by specifying an IP address and port number for the host running your proxy\. After you do so, Storage Gateway routes all AWS endpoint traffic through your proxy server\. Communications between the gateway and endpoints is encrypted, even when using the HTTP proxy\. For information about network requirements for your gateway, see [Network and firewall requirements](Requirements.md#networks)\.<a name="http-proxy-fgw"></a>

**To configure an HTTP proxy for a file gateway**

1. Log in to your gateway's local console:

## Configuring network adapters for your gateway<a name="NICConfiguring-fgw"></a>

By default, Storage Gateway is configured to use the E1000 network adapter type, but you can reconfigure your gateway to use the VMXNET3 \(10 GbE\) network adapter\. You can also configure Storage Gateway so it can be accessed by more than one IP address\. You do this by configuring your gateway to use more than one network adapter\.

**Topics**
+ [Configuring your gateway to use the VMXNET3 network adapter](#NICChanging-fgw)

### Configuring your gateway to use the VMXNET3 network adapter<a name="NICChanging-fgw"></a>

Storage Gateway supports the E1000 network adapter type in both VMware ESXi and Microsoft Hyper\-V hypervisor hosts\. However, the VMXNET3 \(10 GbE\) network adapter type is supported in VMware ESXi hypervisor only\. If your gateway is hosted on a VMware ESXi hypervisor, you can reconfigure your gateway to use the VMXNET3 \(10 GbE\) adapter enter\. For more information on this adapter, see the [VMware website](https://kb.vmware.com/selfservice/microsites/search.do?language=en_US&cmd=displayKC&externalId=1001805)\.

For KVM hypervisor hosts, Storage Gateway supports the use of `virtio` network device drivers\. Use of the E1000 network adapter type for KVM hosts isn't supported\.

**Important**  
To select VMXNET3, your guest operating system enter must be **Other Linux64**\.

Following are the steps you take to configure your gateway to use the VMXNET3 adapter:

1. Remove the default E1000 adapter\.

1. Add the VMXNET3 adapter\.

1. Restart your gateway\.

1. Configure the adapter for the network\.

Details on how to perform each step follow\.

**To remove the default E1000 adapter and configure your gateway to use the VMXNET3 adapter**

1. In VMware, open the context \(right\-click\) menu for your gateway and choose **Edit Settings**\.

1. In the **Virtual Machine Properties** window, choose the **Hardware** tab\.

1. For **Hardware**, choose **Network adapter**\. Notice that the current adapter is E1000 in the **Adapter Enter** section\. You replace this adapter with the VMXNET3 adapter\.  
![\[Image NOT FOUND\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/filegateway/latest/filefsxw/images/VerifyAdapterType.png)

1. Choose the E1000 network adapter, and then choose **Remove**\. In this example, the E1000 network adapter is **Network adapter 1**\.
**Note**  
Although you can run the E1000 and VMXNET3 network adapters in your gateway at the same time, we don't recommend doing so because it can cause network problems\.

1. Choose **Add** to open the Add Hardware wizard\.

1. Choose **Ethernet Adapter**, and then choose **Next**\.

1. In the Network Enter wizard, select **VMXNET3** for **Adapter Enter**, and then choose **Next**\.

1. In the Virtual Machine properties wizard, verify in the **Adapter Enter** section that **Current Adapter** is set to **VMXNET3**, and then choose **OK**\.

1. In the VMware VSphere client, shut down your gateway\.

1. In the VMware VSphere client, restart your gateway\.

After your gateway restarts, reconfigure the adapter you just added to make sure that network connectivity to the internet is established\.

**To configure the adapter for the network**

1. In the VSphere client, choose the **Console** tab to start the local console\. Use the default login credentials to log in to the gateway's local console for this configuration task\. For information about how to log in using the default credentials, see [Logging in to the file gateway local console](#LocalConsole-login-fgw)\.
