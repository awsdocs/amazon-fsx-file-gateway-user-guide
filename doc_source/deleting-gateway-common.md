# Deleting Your Gateway by Using the Storage Gateway Console and Removing Associated Resources<a name="deleting-gateway-common"></a>

If you don't plan to continue using your gateway, consider deleting the gateway and its associated resources\. Removing resources avoids incurring charges for resources you don't plan to continue using and helps reduce your monthly bill\. 

When you delete a gateway, it no longer appears on the Storage Gateway Management Console and its iSCSI connection to the initiator is closed\. The procedure for deleting a gateway is the same for all gateway types; however, depending on the type of gateway you want to delete and the host it is deployed on, you follow specific instructions to remove associated resources\. 

You can delete a gateway using the Storage Gateway console or programmatically\. You can find information following about how to delete a gateway using the Storage Gateway console\. If you want to programmatically delete your gateway, see *[Storage Gateway API Reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/storagegateway/latest/APIReference/)\.*

## Deleting Your Gateway by Using the Storage Gateway Console<a name="delete-gateway-procedure"></a>

The procedure for deleting a gateway is the same for all gateway types\. However, depending on the type of gateway you want to delete and the host the gateway is deployed on, you might have to perform additional tasks to remove resources associated with the gateway\. Removing these resources helps you avoid paying for resources you don't plan to use\. 

**Note**  
For gateways deployed on an Amazon EC2 instance, the instance continues to exist until you delete it\.  
For gateways deployed on a virtual machine \(VM\), after you delete your gateway the gateway VM still exists in your virtualization environment\. To remove the VM, use the VMware vSphere client, Microsoft Hyper\-V Manager, or Linux Kernel\-based Virtual Machine \(KVM\) client to connect to the host and remove the VM\. Note that you can't reuse the deleted gateway's VM to activate a new gateway\.

**To delete a gateway**

1. Open the Storage Gateway console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/storagegateway/home](https://console.aws.amazon.com/storagegateway/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Gateways**, and then choose the gateway you want to delete\.

1. For **Actions**, choose **Delete gateway**\.

1. 
**Warning**  
Before you do this step, be sure that there are no applications currently writing to the gateway's volumes\. If you delete the gateway while it is in use, data loss can occur\.  
Also, when a gateway is deleted, there is no way to get it back\.

   In the confirmation dialog box that appears, select the check box to confirm your deletion\. Make sure the gateway ID listed specifies the gateway you want to delete\. and then choose **Delete**\.

**Important**  
You no longer pay software charges after you delete a gateway, but resources such as virtual tapes, Amazon Elastic Block Store \(Amazon EBS\) snapshots, and Amazon EC2 instances persist\. You will continue to be billed for these resources\. You can choose to remove Amazon EC2 instances and Amazon EBS snapshots by canceling your Amazon EC2 subscription\. If you want to keep your Amazon EC2 subscription, you can delete your Amazon EBS snapshots using the Amazon EC2 console\.

## Removing Resources from a Gateway Deployed On\-Premises<a name="remove-resources-onpremise"></a>

You can use the instructions following to remove resources from a gateway that is deployed on\-premises\.

### Removing Resources from a Volume Gateway Deployed on a VM<a name="MaintenanceDeleteGateway-common"></a>

If the gateway you want to delete are deployed on a virtual machine \(VM\), we suggest that you take the following actions to clean up resources: 
+ Delete the gateway\.

## Removing Resources from a Gateway Deployed on an Amazon EC2 Instance<a name="EC2GatewayCleanup"></a>

If you want to delete a gateway that you deployed on an Amazon EC2 instance, we recommend that you clean up the AWS resources that were used with the gateway, Doing so helps avoid unintended usage charges\.

### Removing Resources from Your Cached Volumes Deployed on Amazon EC2<a name="ec2-delete-cached"></a>

If you deployed a gateway with cached volumes on EC2, we suggest that you take the following actions to delete your gateway and clean up its resources:

1. In the Storage Gateway console, delete the gateway as shown in [Deleting Your Gateway by Using the Storage Gateway Console](#delete-gateway-procedure)\.

1. In the Amazon EC2 console, stop your EC2 instance if you plan on using the instance again\. Otherwise, terminate the instance\. If you plan on deleting volumes, make note of the block devices that are attached to the instance and the devices' identifiers before terminating the instance\. You will need these to identify the volumes you want to delete\. 

1. In the Amazon EC2 console, remove all Amazon EBS volumes that are attached to the instance if you don't plan on using them again\. For more information, see [Clean Up Your Instance and Volume](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-clean-up-your-instance.html) in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances*\.
